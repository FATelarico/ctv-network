This CRAN Task View provides a curated list of R packages for analyzing and modelling networks (also known as *relational data* or *graphs*). These tools facilitate the exploration of natural, social, and other phenomena by focusing on the relationships between entities.

This page lists a number of packages, and sometimes core functions, in several sections based on their scope and focus:

1. The first section outlines the main ecosystems of R packages that include basic network-analytic operations such as creating, manipulating, and describing relational data. 
Here we also list choices of graphical packages for visualizing or drawing networks. 
For those new to network analysis in R, we recommend starting with the [`igraph` introduction](https://igraph.org/c/doc/igraph-Introduction.html) or the [`statnet` tutorial](https://statnet.org/workshop-intro-sna-tools/).

2. Subsequently, packages and functions for advanced network-analytical tasks are presented. 
We currently structure these into three subsections: (1) centrality, (2) community detection, and (3) model-based clustering.

3. Then, packages offering modelling and inferential tools applicable across disciplines and fields of interest are discussed. 
A distinction is drawn between models that are primarily for cross-sectional anddynamic data, with an extra section on special models for multimodal, multilevel, and multiplex data. 

4. Finally, the focus shifts to packages containing data structures, methods, and models with a narrower field of application. 
The list includes some of the areas where network methods are more widely applied: ecology, bibliometrics, life and natural sciences, neurosciences, psychology, public health, social sciences and economics.

The list excludes packages that primarily deal with graph representations of conditional in/dependence between variables. 
This includes Bayesian networks and Markovian graphs, which, despite their relevance to statistical modeling, are covered under the CRAN TaskView `r view("GraphicalModels")`. 
This distinction keeps the list focused on network analysis to explore broader relational dynamics.

Some packages could appear under multiple headings because they can perform multiple tasks (e.g., clustering and visualization). 
But, for the sake of brevity, non-core packages are listed only once: in the section that described each package's main use case.

If you think that a package is missing from the list, please file an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the maintainer.

# Ecosystems

The starting point for analyzing networks in R is to familiarize with the main package 'families' or ecosystems. Using them, users can access functions to create, import/export, edit, and otherwise operate on relational data.

- `r pkg("igraph", priority = "core")` provides tools for creating, manipulating, and analyzing network structures with a focus on graphical representations and fast algorithms to operate on large datasets (particularly manipulating data and dealing with vertex attributes). Rather than coming bundled with other packages, `r pkg("igraph")` offers an ecosystem of extensions and add-ons.

  - *Approach*: This R package is built upon a C library that is shared also by implementations in Python and Mathematica. 
The C code is efficient, and the R interface is increasingly consistent and easy to use with a lot of basic functionality, including calculating network properties, generating random graphs for simulations, etc.

  - *Flexibility*: Many of the functions are provided in two versions: for direct assignment and a pipe-able version.
  
  - *Support*: There are tons of online resources answering virtually any question concerning _how_ to do almost anything thanks to a large community and active maintainers.
  
  - *Extensions*: There are a number of add-on packages that integrate igraph with `r pkg("ggplot2")` and other drawing tools or provide sample datasets. According to the latest review this is the largest network-analysis ecosystem in R by number of extensions (see Kanevsky 2016).

- `r pkg("statnet", priority = "core")`, sometimes used only as `r pkg("sna", priority = "core")` and/or `r pkg("network", priority = "core")` is a more organic family of packages for statistical network analysis built upon common data representations and design choices. But there are also 'add-ons', although not as many as in the previous ecosystem. 

  - *Approach*: The approach in this group of packages is more disaggregated and involves a number of different packages for different purposes. Not least, they provide support to the packages in the `r pkg("ergm")` family.
 
  - *Flexibility*: The packages in `r pkg("statnet")` can be used to analyze (social) network data using both direct assignment and a 'piped' approach. 
 
  - *Comprehensiveness*: This ecosystem's biggest advantage is that it allows users to carry out most network-analytical operations, especially in dealing with social network analysis (SNA). But the trade-off, of course, is that the number of possibilities makes life harder for new users.

- `r pkg("manynet", priority = "core")` is built upon many of the other network packages in this list and offers interoperability with many different classes of objects as well as network visualization and analytic tools.

  - *Approach*: Inspired by the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/), `manynet` offers a piped syntax, with even more structure, consistency, and sensible defaults.
For example, `manynet::net_*` functions always return a single value (scalar), and `manynet::node_*` and `manynet::tie_*` always return a vector the length of the nodes or ties in the network, respectively.
Similarly, `manynet::is_*` functions always return logical values (`TRUE`/`FALSE`), for example. This helps new users and those working with multiple packages alike.
 
  - *Flexibility*: the package leverages S3 dispatching so that all the functions work with many _classes_ of network objects, such as `r pkg ("network")` or `r pkg("graph")` objects, but also edge lists, matrices, and various other more specific classes. 
Its coercion routines retain more information than the long-standing alternative `r pkg ("intergraph")`, being able to transform between more classes and receiving more frequent updates. 
It also includes more complete import and export routines than generalist packages.
 
  - *Comprehensiveness*: the package wraps most of `r pkg("igraph")`'s offerings but extends or corrects them to treat many _types_ of networks, including two-mode, multiplex, and dynamic networks.
The package also implements a number of functions for network analysis that are not available elsewhere.

  - *Documentation*: The package benefits from clear and concise documentation, making it accessible to users of all levels.
Additionally, it offers straightforward tutorials and examples to help users get started with network analysis in R. 
Further explanation, examples, and references are continually being to the documentation to provide user reference and support user experience.

## Network construction

Although the 'core' packages for network analysis in R can create a wide range of networks from different types of inputs, there are also specialized packages for constructing more specialized formats or for converting or coercing between different formats.

- `r pkg("intergraph")` is not a network analysis package _per se_. Rather it allows to easily convert objects produced by `r pkg("statnet")` packages into `r pkg("igraph")` objects (or a data frame) and vice versa. 
Thus, it helps leveraging multiple packages' functionalities and ensuring compatibility between several users' workflows too many additional functionalities.

- `r pkg("BoolNet")` provides tools for assembling, analyzing and visualizing synchronous and asynchronous (probabilistic) Boolean networks as well as simpler Boolean networks.
All the main functions are described in a handy [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BoolNet/vignettes/BoolNet_package_vignette.pdf).
  
- `r pkg("egor")` allows to create ego-centric networks starting from exports from _EgoNet_(`r github("egonet/egonet")`), [_EgoWeb 2.0_](https://www.qualintitative.com/egoweb/) and _openeddi_(`r github("jfaganUK/openeddi")`). It includes a Shiny app and procedures for creating and visualizing clustered graphs.
  
- `r pkg("ionet")` creates network starting by turning input-output tables into weighted adjacency matrices.

- `r pkg("rgraph6")` allows to encode relational data (adjacency matrices, edge lists, `r pkg("network")` and `r pkg("igraph")` objects) as ASCII strings and vice  versa using `graph6`, `sparse6`, and `digraph6` [formats](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt).

- `r pkg("tidygraph")` is designed for handling and manipulating graph data within the [_tidyverse_](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework. It does not make it into ‘core' packages because it lacks a comprehensive set of tools for network analysis.
Yet, it provides a flexible piped approach to working with relational data, allowing users to apply familiar data manipulation techniques from the tidyverse to graphs. 
Users can easily perform tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and joining graph data using familiar tidyverse syntax. 
Given that both `r pkg ("igraph")` and `r pkg ("sna")` provide piped functions for most operations, `r pkg ("tidygraph")`'s added value lies mainly in the possibility of accessing directly either the node data, the edge data or the graph itself while computing inside verbs.

- `r pkg("backbone")` enables the extraction of the sparse and unweighted subgraph of a network called 'backbone'.

## Visualization

### Interactive visualization

More details in the CRAN TaskView `r view("DynamicVisualizations")`.

- `r pkg("visNetwork")` focuses on interactive network visualization using the `vis.js` library (`r github("visjs")`). 
The package  allows users to create visually appealing and interactive network visualizations with features such as zooming, panning, and node highlighting.
It offers a user-friendly interface for creating interactive network visualizations, making it suitable for un-experienced users.

- `r pkg("networkD3")` provides functions that turns edge lists into a D3 JavaScript(`r github("d3/d3")`) network, tree, dendrogram, or Sankey plots.

  - `r pkg("bipartiteD3")` uses the `D3` and `viz.js` libraries for plotting networks produced with the `r pkg("bipartite")` package.

### Static visualization

- `r pkg("diagram")` was born as a companion to the book _A practical guide to ecological modelling_ by K. Soetaert and P.M.J. Herman. But it can visualize  as a flow diagram, a web or grid any network given in the form of a transition matrix. 

- `r pkg("ndtv")` renders network objects from the package `r pkg("networkDynamic")` as videos or interactive animations.

- `r pkg("neatmaps")` tries to simplify the exploratory step of data analysis by providing function to easily produce hierarchical clustering (`neatmaps::hierarchy`), consensus clustering (`neatmaps::consClustResTable`) and heatmaps of multiple networks (`neatmaps::neatmap`).

- `r pkg("manynet")` builds on `r pkg("ggraph")` for graphing networks in `ggplot2`-style but eases the complicated syntax and offers sensible defaults to make it easy to visualize and explore network data while retaining the flexibility to theme. 

	- `manynet::graphr` is for quick, easy network visualization.

	- `manynet::graphs` is for comparing ego networks or subgraphs side by side.

	- `manynet::grapht` is for developing dynamic or longitudinal networks into gifs.

	- `manynet` includes plotting methods for much of its output, including blockmodels and dendrograms for clustering.

### Extensions for `ggplot2`

  - `r pkg("ggnetwork")` offers geometries to plot `r pkg("network")` objects.
 
 - `r pkg("ggraph")` allows to plot `r pkg("igraph")` objects by building up plots layer by layer.
 
 - `r pkg("ggsom")` offers functions to plot self-organizing maps (SOMs). 
 
 - `r pkg("snahelper")` is an add-on allowing access to a GUI for visualizing and analyzing networks. Once the visualization is set, the relevant code is automatically added to the script. 
 
 - `r pkg("roughnet")` leverages the _rough.js_ (`r github("rough-stuff/rough")`) library to draw sketchy, hand-drawn-like networks
 
 - `r pkg("gganimate")` allows to produce GIFs and MP4s version of evolving `ggplots`, including those representing networks. 
 
 - `r pkg("ggdendro")` makes it easy to make ggplots of dendrograms create using the functions `tree`, `hclust`, `dendrogram`, and `rpart`.
 
 - `r pkg("multigraph")` is a powerful tool providing easier visualizations of multigraphs, valued/signed networks, bipartite networks, multilevel networks, and Cayley graphs with various layout options.

### Layouts

 - `r pkg("ggforce")` offers functions for specialized plots, some of which also find application in network analysis. 
Most importantly, alluvial plots can be used to visualize composition of groups in a dynamic network. 

- `r pkg("graphlayouts")` adds several layout algorithms to `r pkg("igraph")` and `r pkg("ggraph")` based on the concept of stress majorization (See also `r pkg("edgebundle")`).
	
- `r pkg("manynet")` includes a few more layout algorithms for multimodal networks.

- `r pkg("RGraphViz")`, available on Bioconductor (`r bioc("Rgraphviz")`), creates a direct link between the `r pkg("graph")` package and the `graphviz` library. 

- `r pkg("patchwork")` allows for arbitrarily complex composition of plots that can be used, for example, in visualizing multipartite and other complex networks.

# Network analysis

`r pkg ("igraph")`, `r pkg ("sna")`, and `r pkg("manynet")` offer functions for a similar set of network-analytic operations, whereas `r pkg ("tidygraph")` is more limited. 
However, some algorithms differ from each other and from those are some specialized packages for their implementation, speed, or defaults.

## Centrality

Both main ecosystems can compute betweenness, eigenvalue, power, and closeness centrality, but `r pkg ("igraph")` offers more options than `r pkg ("sna")` and `r pkg ("tidygraph")` overall. In addition:

- `r pkg("centiserve")` adds dozens of centrality measures for `r pkg ("igraph")` objects such as bottleneck, decay, and entropy centrality.

- `r pkg("birankr")` provides optimized functions for estimating various centrality measures in bipartite/two-mode networks. It can also estimate efficiently page-rank in one-mode networks, project two-mode networks to one-mode ones, and convert edge lists and matrices to the `sparseMatrix` format offered in the package `r pkg("Matrix")`. It supports edge lists (in the `data.frame`, `data.table::data.table`, or `tidydata::tbl_df` class) and adjacency matrices (either in the built-in `matrix` class or in `Matrix`'s `dgCMatrix` class).

- `r pkg("netrankr")` offers index-free centrality rankings via *neighborhood-inclusion* or *positional dominance* and based on probabilistic methods like computing expected node ranks and relative rank probabilities (see also Schoch 2018: `r doi("/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.003")`).

## Community detection

- `r pkg("igraph")` is the package of choice for the implementation of most modularity-based community-detection algorithms.
Available approaches include betweenness, greedy algorithm, infomap, label propagation Leiden, Generalized Louvain, and walktrap amongst others.

- `r pkg("cencrne")` proposes a regularized network-embedding model to simultaneously estimate the community structure and the number of communities in an asymptotically consistent way.
The method is mainly used in life sciences but is applicable across the board.

- `r pkg("linkcomm")` provides functions for generating, visualizing, and analyzing overlapping communities in networks of arbitrary size and type.
Unlike `r pkg("igraph")` and `r pkg ("network")`, it can compute relatedness `linkcomm::getClusterRelatedness` and `linkcomm::getCommunityConnectedness` as well as generate a mesoscopic matrix (`linkcomm::getCommunityMatrix`).
Moreover, it can produce membership for hierarchical communities (`linkcomm::getNestedHierarchies`).

## Model-based clustering 

Model-based clustering is a probabilistic approach to grouping nodes in a network based on their connectivity patterns, assuming that the data arise from a (mixture of) latent distribution(s). These methods are particularly effective for identifying undetected structures and capturing uncertainty in network partitions.

### Generalized blockmodeling (structural and/or regular equivalence)

- `r pkg("sna")` implements a simple version of structural-equivalence blockmodel (`sna::blockmodel`).
It can also generate networks with a given blockmodel as well as print and plot the results.

- `r pkg("concorR")` implements the classical CONCOR (Convergence of iterated Correlation) algorithm (Breiger, Boorman, and Arabie 1975: `r doi("10.1016/0022-2496(75)90028-0")`) for one- and multi-mode un/directed networks.

- `r pkg("BMConcor")` allows the simultaneous blockmodeling of networks based on structural and regular equivalence through singular value decomposition (SVD) by blocks (see Lafosse and Hanafi [1997](https://eudml.org/doc/106424))

- `r pkg("blockmodeling")`: this package offers and implementation of generalized blockmodeling (`blockmodeling::optRandomParC`) as well as functions for computation of (dis)similarities in terms of structural or regular equivalence and plotting. 
Furthermore, it includes implementations of the REGE algorithm (`blockmodeling::REGE`).

- `r pkg("BlockmodelingGUI")` is a Shiny app providing a graphical interface for generalized blockmodeling of single-relation, one-mode networks from the package `r pkg("blockmodeling")`.
It includes several ways to visualize networks and partitions using `r pkg("igraph")`, `r pkg("network")`, and more.

- `r pkg("kmBlock")` implements a k-means like approach to the blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as presented in Žiberna (2020: `r doi("10.1016/j.socnet.2019.10.006")`).

- `r pkg("dBlockmodeling")` contains functions to apply blockmodeling of signed (positive and negative weights are assigned to the links), one-mode and valued one-mode and two-mode.

- `r pkg("signnet")` offers to functions implementing the generalized blockmodeling with structural equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel`) and generalized equivalence (`signnet::signed_blockmodel_general`) of signed networks based on objects from `r pkg("igraph")` 

- `r pkg("oaqc")` enables efficient computation of the orbit-aware quad census from Ortmann and Brandes (2017: `r doi("10.1007/s41109-017-0027-2")`).

### Stochastic blockmodeling (SBM)

- `r pkg("igraph")` cannot run SBMs, but it can generate a random graph according to a specified SBM (`igraph::sample_sbm`) or an arbitrary hierarchical SBM (`igraph::sample_hierarchical_sbm`)

- `r pkg("blockmodels")` allows to run the SBM or the Latent Block Model (LBM, an SBM for bipartite networks) of static networks using a Variational Expectation Maximization algorithm. Various `S4` functions implement three probability distributions: `blockmodels::BM_bernoulli` for binary data, `blockmodels::BM_poisson` for discrete/count weights, `blockmodels::BM_gaussian` for continuous weights. 
It allows for SBMs and LBM with or without node covariates and supports multiplex binary networks via `blockmodels::BM_bernoulli_multiplex`.

- `r pkg("sbm")` is an extension of `blockmodels` for bi- and multi-partite as well as multiplex networks as proposed by Barbillon and colleagues (2017: `r doi("10.1111/rssa.12193")`) through dedicated `R6` classes. 
It includes functions to plot the resulting partition.

- `r pkg ("greed")` leverages a combination of greedy local search and a genetic algorithm (see Côme et al 2021: `r doi("10.1007/s11634-021-00440-z")`) to execute (degree-corrected) SBM and LBM.

- `r pkg("dynsbm")`, archived from the CRAN repository on 2023-10-27 due to a faulty dependence, implements the model for temporal networks presented in Matias and Miele (2020: `r doi("10.1111/rssb.12200")`) which combines a static SBM with independent Markov chains for the dynamic part.
It supports binary and weighted networks with both discrete and continuous edges. Includes also functions for plotting (`dynsbm::adjacency.plot`, `dynsbm::alluvial.plot`, `dynsbm::connectivity.plot`) the partition and automatically constructs matrices as an array of the right format.

- `r pkg("MLVSBM")` Implements the SBM of multilevel networks where the different matrices each represent an interaction layer either weighter or binary. It generalizes the approach proposed by Chabert-Liddell et al. (2021: `r doi("10.1016/j.csda.2021.107179")`) to more than two layers.

- `r pkg("StochBlock")` implements the stochastic blockmodeling of one-mode and linked networks as implemented in Škulj and Žiberna (2022: `r doi("10.1016/j.socnet.2022.12.003")`).
It includes utilities to plot the results but cannot choose automatically the 'right' number of clusters and tends to be very slow according to subsequent reviews (see Cugmas and Žiberna 2023).

- `r pkg("GREMLINS")` implements the SBM of generalized multipartite networks where the different matrices each involve nodes that can be partitioned into  a-priori defined _functional groups_ as proposed by Bar-Hen, Barbillon, and  Donnet (2018: `r doi("10.1177/1471082X20963254")`).

### Others

- `r pkg("clustNet")` allows to cluster units in a network using a Bayesian mixture model that can account for node and edge covariates.

- `r pkg("collpcm")` provides Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference for collapsed latent space models that allow to search over the model space, including deciding on the number of clusters.

- `r pkg("graphclust")` implements an agglomerative algorithm to maximize the integrated classification likelihood criterion and a mixture of stochastic block models based on `r pkg("igraph")` objects.

- `r pkg("latentnet")` provides functions to fit and simulate latent position and cluster model using `r pkg("network")` objects and compatibly with `r pkg("ergm")` approaches.

- `r pkg("latenetwork")` implements Hoshino and Yanagi's (2023) method for the causal inference with noncompliance and network interference of unknown form on average causal using instrumental variables.

- `r pkg("netClust")` provides a function to cluster one-layer (`netClust::netEM_unilayer`) and multilayer (`netClust::netEM_multilayer`) networks by means of finite mixtures and expectation-maximization.

# Statistical modeling

Statistical modelling in network analysis enables researchers to uncover patterns, test hypotheses, and make predictions about network structures and dynamics.
This section introduces R packages that support a range of statistical approaches, from modelling static (cross-sectional) networks to analyzing dynamic, multimodal, and multilevel networks.
These methods provide tools to infer underlying processes that generate observed network data, assess the significance of observed patterns, and simulate network structures under various conditions.

## Cross-sectional networks

It supports  binary networks as well as valued ones (assuming a Gaussian, zero-inflated/tobit, ordinal, or fixed-rank nomination model)

- `r pkg("bootnet")` implements bootstrap procedures to assess accuracy and stability of estimated structures and centrality indices on undirected networks (For an alternative see `r pkg("localboot")`).

- `r pkg("fastnet")` allows to simulate large-scale social networks and retrieve their most relevant metrics following the approach proposed by  Dong, Castro, and Shaikh (2020: `r doi("10.18637/jss.v096.i07")`).

- `r pkg("nda")` gathers non-parametric dimensionality-reduction functions  with/out (automated) feature selection and limited plotting capabilities.

- `r pkg("lolog")` implements Latent Order Logistic (LOLOG) models, a network formation process in which edges are added one at a time drawn from a distribution conditional on edges already added, with order unknown.

- `r pkg("MoNAn")` implements the method to analyze the structure of weighted mobility networks or distribution networks outlined in Block et al (2022: `r doi("10.1016/j.socnet.2021.08.003")`).

- `r pkg("ERPM")` extends exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to explain cross-sectional or longitudinal observed partitions, i.e. sets of non-overlapping groups, such as face-to-face interactions, animal herds, or political coalitions, through group formation processes based on individual attributes, relations between individuals, and size-related factors.

## Multimodal and multilevel networks

- `r pkg("migraph")` is an `r pkg("igraph")` extension to analyze multimodal networks as described in Knoke, Diani, Hollway, and Christopoulos (2021: `r doi("10.1017/9781108985000")`).

- `r pkg("multinets")` is an `r pkg ("igraph")` extension to analyze multilevel networks as described in Lazega and Snijders (2016: `r doi("10.1007/978-3-319-24520-1")`).

- `r pkg("multiplex")` makes possible, among other things, to create and manipulate multiplex, multimode, and multilevel network data with different formats (2020: `r doi("10.18637%2Fjss.v092.i11")`).

- `r pkg("dyads")` offers functions for the MCMC simulation of dyadic network models j2, p2 (also multilevel) and b2 model.

- `r pkg("incidentally")` implements methods to generate incidence matrices as described in Neal (2022: `r doi("10.31219/osf.io/ectms")`).

## Dynamic networks

The following packages focus on modeling and simulation of networks that evolve over time and network processes that occur over time.

### Dynamics and diffusion

- `r pkg("networkDynamic")` from `r pkg("statnet")` allows the management of dynamic networks.
	- `r pkg("tsna")` is used to analyze them.
	- `r pkg("EpiModel")` allows to simulate mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics.

- `r pkg("manynet")` can manipulate, visualize, and analyze longitudinal and network event data, including running contagion/diffusion processes and compartmental models.

- `r pkg("netdiffuseR")` was developed as part of Valente et al. (2015: `r doi("10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001")`).
The package is for empirical statistical analysis, visualization and simulation of network diffusion and contagion processes.
It implements algorithms for calculating network diffusion statistics such as transmission rate, hazard rates, exposure models, network threshold levels, infectiousness (contagion), and susceptibility.

### Relational events

Relational event data contains information about exact times during which the nodes interact. This is commonly observed for e-mail, radio, and other communications.

- `r pkg("rem")` and `r pkg("relevent")` both contain functions to fit and simulate dyad-oriented relational event models.
But only `r pkg("relevent")` can estimate event sequence data without time stamps.

- `r pkg("goldfish")` offers functions to fit and simulate actor-oriented dynamic network actor models and dyad-oriented relational event models as described in Stadtfeld et al. (2017: `r doi("10.1177/00811750177092")`).

### Discrete observations

The following package are focused on modeling series of networks, also known as panel data.

- `r pkg("tergm")` a set of extensions for `r pkg("ergm")` for fitting and simulating discrete-time models for series of networks (or a long-term equilibrium of a discrete-time network process) where each time step is modeled as a draw from an ERGM conditional on the prior time steps.

- `r pkg("dnr")` estimation of discrete-time models for series of networks where each time-step is modeled as a draw from an ERGM conditional on prior time steps, subject to the constraint that within each time step, edge variables are independent. Varying node sets are also supported.

- `r pkg("btergm")` bootstrap inference for discrete-time models for series of networks where each time step is modeled as a draw from an ERGM conditional on the prior time steps.

- `r pkg("RSiena")` estimation of continuous-time Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) for panel network data.

- `r pkg("idopNetwork")` implments the model proposed by Cao et al (2022: `r doi("10.1080/19490976.2022.2106103")`) to convert static data into their 'dynamic' form contextually inferring informative, dynamic, multi-directional networks with clusterable structures.


# Field packages

As an interdisciplinary approach, network analysis is used in a number of fields, where the specific needs and interests of those fields are addressed by particular packages.

## Ecological networks

- `r pkg("econetwork")` is a collection of advanced functions to analyze and models of ecological networks (mainly food webs and host-parasite relations, but also plant-pollinator and other mutualistic ones) statically and dynamically (based on Ohlmann et al 2023: `r doi("10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110424")`). 

- `r pkg("AnimalHabitatNetwork")` provides functions for generating and visualizing networks representing the physical configurations of animal habitats. It implements an original  network-generating algorithm based on pair-wise Euclidean distances and can output undirected network either weighted or binary, fully connected or sparse). 
The package is associated with a PDF on modelling the physical configurations of animal habitats using networks.
